Sonic QX Development Pack
06/21/09
==============================================================================

This is a collection of unprotected CCA files for Sonic QX. They served as
backups during it's development, and now they are being made available to the
public. I have gotten many comments from people over the years telling me they
didn't realize Multimedia Fusion could do binary operations. Therefore, I have
decided to release them as a way of providing insight on how Sonic QX was
actually created. All files in this pack are provided on an as-is basis.

All the CCA files open without any problems under Multimedia Fusion v1.2 build
97. You will need to make sure you have all the required COX extension files.
The extensions used are as follows:

- binary.cox
- garray.cox
- iniplus.cox
- kcbase.cox
- kcbutton.cox
- kccombo.cox
- kcdialog.cox
- kcdraw.cox
- kcedit.cox
- kcfile.cox
- kcinput.cox
- kclist.cox
- kcstore.cox
- scrollbar.cox

Provided below is a list of the CCA files this pack contains:

- Voice.cca     (04/07/03)
- Sqx99.cca     (04/19/03)
- Sqx.cca       (04/29/03)
- Sqx00.cca     (08/31/03)
- Sqx2.cca      (11/09/03)
- Sqx22.cca     (11/14/03)
- Sqx23.cca     (11/15/03)
- Sqx24a.cca    (11/16/03)
- Sqx24.cca     (11/19/03)
- Sqx25.cca     (12/01/03)
- Sqx26.cca     (12/03/03)
- Sqx27.cca     (12/13/03)
- Sqx28.cca     (12/17/03)
- Sqx29.cca     (12/23/03) -- first public release (build 13)
- Sqx30.cca     (04/11/04)
- Sqx31.cca     (04/24/04) -- third and last public release (build 15)
- Sqx32.cca     (05/19/04) -- unreleased continuation of the program


Also included is the build 15 release (Sonicqx.exe), revised build 15 manual
(Sqx.doc), and the source code to the unreleased C version (Sqxcsrc.zip.) The
C version can be compiled under Visual C++ 6. I have no idea if it compiles
under other compilers without modifications or not.


I know SQX isn't in high demand these days, but I hope some of you will learn
a thing or two from what I have provided here!
