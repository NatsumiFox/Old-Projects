Format level IDs as hex just like if you were changing them manually (ex: GHZ1 would be 0000, MZ2 would be 0201...) and input the ID when prompted. Then, once done, copy the sequence produced to lvl_ord.bin.

This is just a Python script; I made it to relieve some tedium for myself, and thought others might benefit.
