# Old-Projects

A bunch of stuff from years past. Not everything I've worked on for obvious reasons, but a large number of various projects that were worth at all sharing. Most stuff made by me, however...

## Warning

Some of this stuff is made by other people, or have been stolen/found/etc. Use at your own risk

Also, content warning: Some of this was never really created with the idea that they will see the light of day. May contain very inappropriate language, or files that I have forgotten about that have nothing to do with the project in question. I was pretty immature especially around 2014-2018 about this stuff so you're likely to find something that doesn't at all reflect my values today. I am not going through hundreds of thousands of lines of code to censor my past self though.
