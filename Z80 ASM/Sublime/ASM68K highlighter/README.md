# asm68k-68k-z80-Assembly

A Motorola 68000 assembly language package for the
[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) editor, based on
[m68k-Assembly](https://github.com/stevenjs/M68k-Assembly), and the
[M68k](https://github.com/stevenjs/M68k.tmbundle) bundle for
[Textmate](http://macromates.com). This modification was made by Natsumi, to more closer support ASM68K specific macros and Z80 code highlighting. Please refer to README-ORIGINAL for more information.
