    <h1>Playing the Hack</h1>
    <p>Thank you for downloading Sonic 3 & Knuckles - Battle Race.</p>
    <p>To get started, you'll need an emulator to play the hack. <b>Kega Fusion</b> is great because you can use it to play online with your friends. You can also use <b>Regen</b> and <b>Bizhawk</b> to play the hack with.
        Unfortunately, <b>Gens</b> and all the related emulators do not work correctly, and therefore the hack is unplayable on them. The hack also works on real hardware using flash carts.</p>
    <p>The hack is 2-player only, so you need a friend to play with. Like mentioned, <b>Kega Fusion</b> has a netplay feature, which allows you to play over the internet with someone who lives far away. Other emulators may have this feature as well.</p>
